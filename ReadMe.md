	This application started as a way for me to focus at work and
studies, but fortunatly I was able to make a joke out of it and test many
fascinating programming tools. It's a very simple Tkinter GUI simulating
the pomodore technique(with KITTENS!!), but I want to add SFX to it, an 
.exe file and perhaps try to build it using another module/lib.

	Work still in progress.
