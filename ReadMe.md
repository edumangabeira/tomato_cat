This application started as a way for me to focus at work and
studies, but fortunately I was able to make a joke out of it and test many
fascinating programming tools, such as POO, totally new to me. It's a very simple Tkinter GUI 
simulating the pomodore technique (w/ KITTENS!!), but I want to add SFX 
to it, an .exe file and perhaps try to build it using another module/lib.

Work still in progress.
